**duo_java** - Duo two-factor authentication for Java web applications

This package allows a web developer to quickly add Duo's interactive, self-service, two-factor authentication to any web login form - without setting up secondary user accounts, directory synchronization, servers, or hardware.

What's here:

* `js` - Duo Javascript library, to be hosted by your webserver.
* `DuoWeb` - Duo Java SDK to be integrated with your web application, including unit tests

# Usage

This library requires Java 6 or later.

The Java WebSDK project is not currently available from Duo Security on Maven.  Currently this GitHub project is the only supported source for the Duo Java WebSDK.
